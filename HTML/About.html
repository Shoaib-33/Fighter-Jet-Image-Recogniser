    <h1>Fighter Jet Image Recognizer Project</h1>
    <p>The Fighter Jet Image Recognizer project aims to develop an intelligent system that can accurately identify and classify fighter jet aircraft based on their visual characteristics. This project utilizes advanced image recognition techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze and process visual data, enabling the system to make precise identifications of various fighter jet models.</p>
